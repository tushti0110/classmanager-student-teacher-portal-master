# Descriptive answer checker
This project has been built using HTML, CSS, Python and Django. It evaluates **handwritten** answers submitted by the student and scores them against the required answer submitted by the teacher. We use 5 techniques to determine the score, each evaluating an important aspect of the student's answer, very similar to how a teacher evaluates answers. 

The techniques used are:
* Jaccard Similarity
* Keyword matching
* Sentence similarity
* Semantic similarity - BERT
* Concept Graph
